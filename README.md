# Joyal_Demonstration_Project
Interactive lab demonstrating Joyal’s bijection from functions to labeled trees. Includes real-time visualization, empirical validation for small  𝑛 n, and a modular 5-cell architecture. Designed for clarity, speed, and mathematical insight into the structure behind  𝑛 𝑛 n n  functions and  𝑛 𝑛 − 2 n n−2  trees.
